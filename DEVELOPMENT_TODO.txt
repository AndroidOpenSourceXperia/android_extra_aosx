DEVELOPMENT TODO:
1) Compile ST-Ericsson binaries from source (Hard & Maybe illegal)
2) Update to 3.4 Kernel (Hard)
3) Fix Wi-Fi Direct (Hard)
4) Fix A2DP (Hard)
5) Fix NFC Tags and HDMI (Hard)
6) Fix FM Radio (Hard)

DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION:
1) These sources are leaked sources downloaded from XDA-Developers forum. Although most of the sources are Apache v2 licensed, there are some crucial parts which are proprietary.
   The legal status of these sources are yet unknown as ST-Ericsson does not exist now and both ST-Microelectronics as well as Ericsson has failed to respond to any query regarding the usage of these sources. 
   Sources can be found on searching "ST-Ericsson-U8500". The right repository include the follow foldes:
   - modem
   - st-ericsson-android
   - st-ericsson-vendor
   This sources are working on Android 4.1.2. This mean that many stuff must be adapt/update. 
   
   Tips and tricks:
   Is hard build only a specific binary due dependences. In order to build are present several root makefiles e.g. st-ericsson-vendor/multimedia/linux/build/Android.mk.

2) We have 3 branches in our github.com/AndroidOpenSourceXperia/android_kernel_sony_u8500:
   - Master: Is the kernel in our ROMs. In origin 3.0.8 updated by @Munjeni to 3.0.101. 
	     It include these hacks:
	     - cw1200 wirless driver port from 2.6 by compat-wireless. 
	     - cg2900 bluetooth driver adapted to 3.4 kernel + 3.4 bluetooth subsystem copy/past from backports.
	     - F2FS support
   - 3.4: It is our test kernel. It consist in 3.4 kernel sources from Bamboo phone + our port of Riogrande board. 
	  It compile fine but not boot, probably due different I/O pins. This imply that for debug is necessary read logs from UART. 
	  More info about UART on Xperia U can be found at the follow URLs:
	  - forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=51288227&postcount=762
          - forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=55165216&postcount=1681
   - 3.4-XM: This is clean 3.4 kernel + XMelancholy port of Riogrande board. It is cleaner than 3.4 and Master but it not compile.
   
   Tips and tricks:
   - Current cg2900 bluetooth driver can be used in 3.4 kernel.
   - There is 3.4 compatible cw1200 wireless driver in current backports but they need some fix because wlan0 is not created.
 
3) In Android Ice Cream Sandwich Wi-Fi Direct use same interface of Wi-Fi. In Android KitKat Wi-Fi Direct use own "p2p0" interface.
   The cw1200 wireless driver do not support 2 interfaces running simultaneously in the same wireless card.
   In order to fix it there are 3 ways:
   - Hack the driver in order to allow  2 interfaces running simulaneously.
   - Use wlan0 for all tasks.
   - Power off wlan0 and power up p2p0 when Wi-Fi Direct is activated.
   
   Tips and tricks:
   - This commit: github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_base/commit/dbe2bcc1e5bbbe5b4a525c64d9e6f28888bfdbb2 cause Wi-Fi Direct freeze.
   - Useful documentation: processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/TI-Android-JB-PortingGuide#WLAN
   
4) ST-Ericsson customize very hard android audio subsystem. This costumization include also BlueZ 4.X. 
   Due Android choose Bluedroid as Buetooth reference stack, we do not have any exploitable source to port.from  Android Ice Cream Sandwich.
   More information can be found at this URL: github.com/CyanogenMod/android_external_bluetooth_bluez/commit/0162ec71d12070e81869931908b01a3e3f289802.
   In order to fix A2DP is necessary update and standardize Audio HAL, because BlueZ 5.X is based on it.

   - Useful documentation: source.android.com/devices/audio.html

5) None

6) In order to exploit FM Radio is necessary write an application that exploit it. Leacked sources provide it but it is deprecated due very different Android audio subsystem.
   Easyest way consists in adapt Qualcomm FM App to exploit our chip. This can be obtained replacing specific Qualcomm API with ST-Ericsson API provided by github.com/AndroidOpenSourceXperia/android_hardware_libhardware/blob/kitkat/include/fmradio.h.
   
   Tips and tricks:
   - Source code of Qualcomm FM App: github.com/CyanogenMod/android_hardware_qcom_fm
   - Qualcomm FM App use many V4L API, they are compatible with our chip.
   - All ST-Ericsson FM stuff present in CyanogenMod's code are obsolete.
   - In CyanogenMod's code there are many #ifdef that involve Qualcomm FM, compare them with old ST-Ericsson #ifdef.
