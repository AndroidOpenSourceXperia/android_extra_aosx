[*]CyanogenMod's Torch
[*]CyanogenMod's BusyBox
[*]CyanogenMod's Browser

[/LIST]
plus some hardware and development stuff. For more information check our [URL="https://github.com/AndroidOpenSourceXperia/android_scripts/blob/master/.repo/local_manifests/local_manifest.xml"]local_manifest.xml[/URL].


[B]Why don't you keep it pure AOSP ?[/B]
Because our goal is to provide a user friendly and clean ROM. We chose these applications because they are opensource and advertisement free. 


[B]I do not like some pre-installed applications, how I can delete them ?[/B]
If you do not like them, just uninstall them with a rooted uninstaller like [URL="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rootuninstaller.free&hl=en"]Root Uninstaller[/URL].


[B]Feature X is not working or applications Y is force closed, what can I do ?[/B]
Usually this kind of problem is due to dirty installation. Please wipe data, cache and dalvik cache.


[B]I found a bug. How do I report it ?[/B]
Create a bug report on [URL="https://code.google.com/p/android-open-source-xperia-project/issues/list"]Bug Tracker[/URL] and remember to attach a logcat, otherwise your report will be ignored. Also try to attach the log of only the relevant part.
